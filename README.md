Electron app to connect to the Data Center Enseignement clusters of CentraleSup√©lec - Metz

This app allows to get connected to either the GPU or CPU clusters and then to execute programs on it such as VNC (with port_forwarding). 

## Prerequisites

We need you to have `ssh-keygen` installed on your system. On Linux or MacOS, this should be already available. On Windows, you may need to [activate the OpenSSH extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse).

On all the OS, you can check this works by ensuring you can execute the command `ssh-keygen` from a terminal.

## Installing

To install the app for your OS, please select the appropriate runnable from the releases on the [Release page](https://github.com/jeremyfix/dcejs/releases).

## Running

If you just want to test and run the app and have a Node installation, you just need to

	cd app
	yarn
	yarn start
